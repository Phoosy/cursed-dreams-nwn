# Cursed Dreams
Cursed Dreams is a built-from-the-ground-up horror module for Neverwinter Nights focused on the survival of the players in a land that is as hostile as the creatures found within it. Heavily inspired by the numerous Zombie Survival genre of modules, Cursed Dreams seeks to reinvigorate the genre and free itself from the shackles of modules held down and back by the hands of numerous developers over 10+ years of development. It is my goal to recreate the magic and fear that old school Zombie Survival servers carried when players were first introduced to them without rehashing the same tired areas, creatures, and systems that regularly did more harm than good to the well being and integrity of the module and codebase.

I will be making use of the Wiki and Projects sections of GitHub to outline my plans in detail going forward in the coming days.

## Format
The Packed folder will contain the latest loadable module file, with major module revisions being maintained in case I need to go back and reference module changes without having to go revert a bunch of unpacked file commits to scripts and the like.

The Unpacked folder is the result of the ModUnpacker utility that extracts the module contents in raw file format, which allows me to edit scripts directly instead of loading the toolset to do so. I will also be able to compile code changes outside the toolset using another utility (pending me getting it set up correctly).

## Contributors
I will be keeping tabs on script systems, haks, tilesets, etc. that I utilize in Cursed Dreams here, along with code contributors helping me create this monster.

## License
Won't have anything here yet. Intention is to publish under GPLv3, but as of now I'm not entirely sure of everything I will be incorporating and whether or not I can even do so, anyway, with the resources I ultimately utilize!

Regardless, any content/copyrights applicable to Bioware, Atari, Dungeons and Dragons, Wizards of the Coast, etc. that are applicable to them apply here.
